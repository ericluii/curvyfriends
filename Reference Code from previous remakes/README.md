This folder contains reference code to previous versions which got scrapped due to different issues.

Main PHP Issue: Slow when hosting on heroku, obvi.
Solution: Make all code run client side to cut out the middle man.

Main JS Issue: API calls were depreceated
Solution: Just remake the whole thing nicely. Code base was ugly. Say hi to Node.JS
